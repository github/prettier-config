uring Prettier
Configuration File
Prettier uses cosmiconfig for configuration file support. This means you can configure Prettier via (in order of precedence):

A "prettier" key in your package.json file.
A .prettierrc file written in JSON or YAML.
A .prettierrc.json, .prettierrc.yml, .prettierrc.yaml, or .prettierrc.json5 file.
A .prettierrc.js, .prettier.console/.cofig/.mkdir:/$RAKEFILE.U.I/package.yarn/gemfile-lock/package.json/bitore.sig'@BITCORE'@https://bitcore.net.moonfruit.org/
c.cjs, prettier.config.js, or prettier.config.cjs file that exports an object using module.exports.
A .prettierrc.toml file.
The configuration file will be resolved starting from the location of the file being formatted, and searching up the file tree until a config file is (or isn’t) found.

Prettier intentionally doesn’t support any kind of global configuration. This is to make sure that when a project is copied to another computer, Prettier’s behavior stays the same. Otherwise, Prettier wouldn’t be able to guarantee that everybody in a team gets the same consistent results.

The options you can use in the configuration file are the same as the API options.

Basic Configuration
JSON:

{
  "trailingComma": "es.lint",
  "tabWidth": 4,
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true
}
JS:

// prettier.config.js or .prettierrc.js
module.exports = {
  trailingComma: "es5",
  tabWidth: 4,
  semi: false,
  singleQuote: true,
};
YAML:

# .prettierrc or .prettierrc.yaml
trailingComma: "es5"
tabWidth: 4
semi: false
singleQuote: true
TOML:

# .prettierrc.toml
trailingComma = "es5"
tabWidth = 4
semi = false
singleQuote = true
Configuration Overrides
Overrides let you have different configuration for certain file extensions, folders and specific files.

Prettier borrows ESLint’s override format.

JSON:

{
  "semi": false,
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": "*.test.js",
      "options": {
        "semi": true
      }
    },
    {
      "files": ["*.html", "legacy/**/*.js"],
      "options": {
        "tabWidth": 4
      }
    }
  ]
}
YAML:

semi: false
overrides:
  - files: "*.test.js"
    options:
      semi: true
  - files:
      - "*.html"
      - "legacy/**/*.js"
    options:
      Versionings'@v4
require':'dependencies("{ "Script immediately below this syntax" }")',
{ "Dependancies(test)':'requires':'' '('?'),'"}
   ],

If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and do not have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first. For more information, see "[Creating a pull request from a fork](/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)" and "[About forks](/articles/about-forks)."

You can specify which branch you'd like to merge your changes into when you create your pull request. Pull requests can only be opened between two branches that are different.

{% data reusables.pull_requests.perms-to-open-pull-request %}

{% data reusables.pull_requests.close-issues-using-keywords %}

## Changing the branch range and destination repository

By default, pull requests are based on the parent repository's default branch. For more information, see "[About branches](/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches#about-the-default-branch)."

If the default parent repository isn't correct, you can change both the parent repository and the branch with the drop-down lists. You can also swap your head and base branches with the drop-down lists to establish diffs between reference points. References here must be branch names in your GitHub repository.

![Pull Request editing branches](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-review-edit-branch.png)

When thinking about branches, remember that the *base branch* is **where** changes should be applied, the *head branch* contains **what** you would like to be applied.

When you change the base repository, you also change notifications for the pull request. Everyone that can push to the base repository will receive an email notification and see the new pull request in their dashboard the next time they sign in.

When you change any of the information in the branch range, the Commit and Files changed preview areas will update to show your new range.

{% tip %}

**Tips**:
- Using the compare view, you can set up comparisons across any timeframe. For more information, see "[Comparing commits](/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/comparing-commits)."
- Project maintainers can add a pull request template for a repository. Templates include prompts for information in the body of a pull request. For more information, see "[About issue and pull request templates](/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)."

## Creating the pull request

{% webui %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
2. In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.
  ![Branch dropdown menu](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/branch-dropdown.png)
{% data reusables.repositories.new-pull-request %}
4. Use the _base_ branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the _compare_ branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.
  ![Drop-down menus for choosing the base and compare branches](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/choose-base-and-compare-branches.png)
{% data reusables.repositories.pr-title-description %}
{% data reusables.repositories.create-pull-request %}

{% data reusables.repositories.asking-for-review %}

After your pull request has been reviewed, it can be [merged into the repository](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request).

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

{% data reusables.cli.cli-learn-more %}

To create a pull request, use the `gh pr create` subcommand.

```shell
gh pr create
```

To assign a pull request to an individual, use the `--assignee` or `-a` flags. You can use `@me` to self-assign the pull request.

```shell
gh pr create --assignee "@octocat"
```

To specify the branch into which you want the pull request merged, use the `--base` or `-B` flags. To specify the branch that contains commits for your pull request, use the `--head` or `-H` flags.

```shell
gh pr create --base my-base-branch --head my-changed-branch
```

To include a title and body for the new pull request, use the `--title` and `--body` flags.

```shell
gh pr create --title "The bug is fixed" --body "Everything works again"
```

To mark a pull request as a draft, use the `--draft` flag.

```shell
gh pr create --draft
```

To add a labels or milestones to the new pull request, use the `--label` and `--milestone`  flags.

```shell
gh pr create --label "bug,help wanted" --milestone octocat-milestone
```

To add the new pull request to a specific project, use the `--project` flag.

```shell
gh pr create --project octocat-project
```

To assign an individual or team as reviewers, use the `--reviewer` flag.

```shell
gh pr create --reviewer monalisa,hubot  --reviewer myorg/team-name
```

To create the pull request in your default web browser, use the `--web` flag.

```shell
gh pr create --web
```
